# TiePieLCR hardware
Contains the design files of the TiePieLCR multi-frequency spectrometer front-end. The TiePieLCR consists of a TiePie engineering HS5 with custom PCB and a 3D printed case. The front-end contains an instrumentation amplifier to measure differential voltages, a transimpedance amplifier to measure currents and  voltage controlled current source to be able to do safe current controlled measurements on humans.

To make one of your own you can use the supplied gerber files to get a PCB fabricated. To make some improments to design you can open the schematic in Kicad. The STL's and Inventor files of the case for the electronics can also be found in this repository.
